Like a lot of people I love The Office (US) and have been through countless rewatches of the show. Here are a few trivia tidbits that I always found interesting.

* When @Meredith comes back to work after getting hit by Michael's car, she asks Jim to sign her pelvic cast. He appears to sign it using John Krasinski (his real name).
* @Nick (the tall and "strange" IT guy) originally appeared during the Job Fair episode as a graphic design recruiter.
* The paper highlighted in @The Office opening credits is actually from the Los Angeles Department of City Planning.
* @The Office has a higher than average percentage of green-eyed employees. Thirty percent of the main employees at Dunder Mifflin had green eyes: Jim, Michael, Angela, Pam, Nellie and Pete, while only about two percent of the worldâ€™s population is green-eyed.
* @Steve Carell (Michael) was not scripted to kiss Oscar in the Gay Witch Hunt episode. The reactions filmed were from cast members surprised at the moment.
